I saw a need for the company to obtain an efficient way to keep track of the studentâ€™s progress and to log their homework, so I designed and developed a web app MVP for them. This was my first attempt at building an MVP for a client and I learnt a lot about using PHP and MySQL for my backend. The app was developed using a LAMP stack and it was deployed and utilised by the company.", "link": "http://scimatics.annetawamono.co.za/", "type": "web"},
